<!-- Simple SVG placeholder icons for the extension -->
<!-- This is a text file to show what the icons should look like -->
<!-- You can replace these with actual PNG icons later -->

Icon sizes needed:
- 16x16 pixels (icon16.png)
- 32x32 pixels (icon32.png) 
- 48x48 pixels (icon48.png)
- 128x128 pixels (icon128.png)

The icons should be a simple quote symbol or inspiring design.

For now, let's create a simple text file that explains how to add icons.
You can use any online icon generator or design tool to create PNG icons.

Suggested design: A speech bubble with quotation marks inside.
